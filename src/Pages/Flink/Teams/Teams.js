        <h2>1. NATURE OF THE CONTENT APPEARING ON OUR SERVICES</h2>
        <p id="fb">
          1.1 OVERVIEW Our Services may include text, data, graphics, images, or
          other content (collectively, "Content") created by us or third
          parties, including health care providers and partners such as
          physicians, hospitals, polyclinics, laboratories, scan centers and
          pharmacies.
          <br /> 1.2 OUR SERVICES Our services include this Site and an
          application which allows users to book healthcare providers including
          clinics, hospitals, or diagnostic labs for physical consultations. Our
          Public and Protected Services are collectively referred to as the
          "Services". In other words, our Services are only intended to help you
          search and book an appointment with a Provider. You acknowledge that
          some of the Services are made available under various names. You also
          acknowledge that the Services may be made available under (i) certain
          MidCare subsidiaries and affiliates or (ii) independent Providers
          <br />
        </p>
        <p id="sb">
          1.2.1 Public Services We make some Services available without
          registering or obtaining a password. We call these "Public Services."
          You may make personal, non-commercial use of the Public Services so
          long as you comply with these Terms. These Services include
          directories ("Directories") for physicians, medical consultants, and
          laboratory and scan centers' branches, collectively ("Providers"). The
          Directories are provided for your convenience. The Directories only
          include Providers who use our Services and who have chosen to
          participate in the Directories. The listing of a Provider within the
          Directories does not constitute a recommendation for the services of
          such Provider or a warranty of the certifications or qualifications of
          such Provider. As all information is relayed as submitted by the
          Providers, and while we make reasonable efforts to provide you with
          accurate content, we do not guarantee, represent, nor warrant, whether
          expressed or implied, the accuracy of any information with respect to
          professional qualifications, expertise, quality of work, price or cost
          information, insurance, or any other content available through the
          services. In no event shall we be liable to you or anyone else for any
          decision made or action taken by you in reliance on any such content.
          We do not in any way endorse or recommend any individual or entity
          listed or accessible through the services. While bookings may be made
          through our site, we cannot guarantee the availability of the relevant
          Provider, nor can we foresee appointment cancellations.
          <br /> <br />
          1.2.2 Protected Services Some of our Services are protected by
          technical measures intended to safeguard the confidentiality,
          integrity and accessibility of sensitive information our Users store
          and share using our Services. We call these "Protected Services." One
          such safeguard is requiring each User to be properly authenticated by
          means of authorization ("Credentials"), such as unique identifiers,
          usernames, passwords, and the like. In order to obtain Credentials,
          you must provide certain information about yourself. If you are
          registering for a Protected Service, or accessing or using, or
          attempting to access or use, a Protected Service on behalf of, or for
          the benefit of, someone other than yourself - such as any of your
          family members (each, a "Principal") - you must also identify and
          provide information about each Principal. Further terms and conditions
          related to User Registration are highlighted in Section 6. These
          Protected Services are all Services that build you a personal Medical
          Record ("Medical Record"), such as receiving your medical information
          and results from Providers like laboratories, scan centers and
          physicians' accounts. This data is completely private and secured and
          we hereby guarantee so. You are the owner of the data and by clicking
          "I agree", you give the Providers the right to send you the
          information through your private account on the Site. In order to help
          you build your own electronic Medical Record, you may agree to send a
          copy of this data to the supplier doctor through our Services, which
          will be protected and kept private as well and cannot be shared with
          third parties. The supplier doctor will keep it under your name on his
          account for building your Medical Record at the clinic. In case you do
          not agree to keep a Medical Record of your data, you can send MidCare
          your request expressing your desire not to share, and MidCare shall
          comply with this request.
        </p>
        <p>
          1.3 CONTENT Our Services allow you to access reviews and other forums
          where various Users can share information, opinions, ratings and other
          Content. We generally do not pre-screen or monitor submitted Content,
          and such Content may simply represent a user's opinion. Our Services
          may also include survey results, ratings or testimonials
          ("Evaluations") from users that may endorse, recommend, critique,
          analyze, evaluate or otherwise describe the Providers and the nature
          or quality of the Services received by such user. Such Evaluations are
          anecdotal first-hand accounts of individual Users, and do not
          constitute neither a Provider's judgment nor the product of medical
          science. You should understand that the Evaluations expressed therein
          are of those who provide the same, that it does not reflect the
          opinions of MidCare, and does not in any way constitute or imply our
          endorsement or recommendation thereof. Thus, MidCare shall not assume
          any liability for any of the posted Evaluations. Further, you should
          bear in mind that Evaluations are subject to errors and biases that
          are common in anecdotal first- hand accounts, and should not to be
          presumed to be reliable or error-free. Any Content that you obtain or
          receive from MidCare, its employees, contractors, partners, sponsors,
          advertisers, licensors or otherwise through the Services, is for
          informational, scheduling and payment purposes only. All information
          is for informational purposes only, and does not constitute medical
          advice. The information offered on the Site is not a substitute for
          medical advice from qualified healthcare professionals. If you rely on
          any Content, including reviews, you do so solely at your own risk. We
          encourage you to independently confirm any Content relevant to you
          with other sources, including the Healthcare Provider's office,
          medical associations relevant to the applicable specialty, your state
          medical boards, and the appropriate licensing or certification
          authorities to verify listed credentials and education.
        </p>
        <h2>2. PRIVACY AND SECURITY POLICY</h2>
        <p>
          2.1 MidCare and its affiliates consider the privacy of your health
          information to be one of the most important elements in our
          relationship with you. Our responsibility to maintain the
          confidentiality of your health information is one that we take very
          seriously. We are required by law to maintain the privacy and security
          of your protected health information. We will let you know promptly if
