          potential risk and fraud (in particular, your IP address), and more
          generally to improve and optimize MedCare (for example, by generating

        <h2>3. Protecting Your information</h2>
        <p id="tb">
          3.1 We strive to protect your information using international
          protection standards and implement a variety of security measures to
          maintain the safety of your personal information when you place a
          booking or enter, submit, or access your personal information
          <br />
          <br />. 3.2 We scan our website and application regularly for security
          holes and vulnerabilities to ensure your visit to our site is as a
          secure as possible. We protect our website through a Web Application
          Firewall, which filters and monitors the traffic between a
          web-application and the internet. It detects and blocks common
          application layer vulnerabilities at the network edge.
          <br />
          <br /> 3.3 We offer the use of a secure server. All supplied
          sensitive/credit information is transmitted via Secure Socket Layer
          (SSL) technology and then encrypted into our Payment Gateway
          Providers’ database only to be accessible by those authorized with
          special access rights to such systems and are required to keep the
          information confidential.
          <br />
          <br /> 3.4 We store our data with external provider that holds
          industry-recognized certifications and audits, including PCI DSS Level
          1, ISO 27001, FISMA Moderate, FedRAMP, HIPAA, and SOC 1 (formerly
          referred to as SAS 70 and/or SSAE 16) and SOC 2 audit reports.
          <br />
          <br /> 3.5 We also ensure all of our data is password protected, and
          enabled with multi-factor authentication. Not every member of the
          MedCare team is able to access any data collected, only those with
          specific roles are permitted to view the data collected. When we store
          your data on our servers, we pseudonymize and encrypt it to maintain
          anonymity and provide an additional layer of security in case of a
          data breach.
        </p>
        <h2>4. How Long We Keep Your Data</h2>
        <p id="tb">
          4.1 The criteria used to determine the period of storage of personal
          data is the respective statutory retention period. After the
          expiration of that period, the corresponding data is routinely
          deleted, as long as it is no longer necessary for the fulfillment of
          our services.<br /><br /> 4.2 We process and store your personal data only for the
          period necessary to achieve the purpose of storage. Accordingly, if we
          have your email address because we provide certain services to you, we
          keep that email address throughout the time we provide those services
          to you. <br /><br />4.3 Essentially, we maintain your data until the deletion of
          your account. You can view the data we collect from you at any time,
          and may request its deletion at any time through your account
          settings.
